# Attendance-Management-System
Integration Between Mobile Application And Web Server <br/>
The interaction between the application and the server will occur in several occasions, </br>
first the application will upload the attendance report to the server by sending a https request, <br/>
the server itself will reply with a response indicating the success of the first interaction,</br>
then the server will interact with the database to get the data required for the creation of the attendance sheet, <br/>
finally the application will request the attendance sheet from the server <br/>
