# Attendance-Management-System
Integration Between Mobile Application And Web Server
The interaction between the application and the server will occur in several occasions,
first the application will upload the attendance report to the server by sending a https request, 
the server itself will reply with a response indicating the success of the first interaction,
then the server will interact with the database to get the data required for the creation of the attendance sheet, 
finally the application will request the attendance sheet from the server
